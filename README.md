## Introduction

<a id="i-esum"></a>

#### Executive Summary 

Children with Autism often find it hard to recognise and manage emotions which can result in a lot of problems as they grow. This can result unnecessary miscommunication, confusion and confrontations. 

#### Problem Statement 
<a name="i_ps"></a>
One of the major problems faced by people with Autism is reading facial emotions and reacting accordingly. Currently children with Autism are being trained in schools to read emotions with still images, photographs and mirrors to understand and learn about facial emotions. However, there is a jump between school environment to the real world on reading emotions. The goal of this project is to reduce the gap between the school environment and the real world to help better equip the students.
